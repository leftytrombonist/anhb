In our twenty-ninth AME Podcast, we continue our quest to serve artistic excellence through a conversation with Jenn Ambrosiano, flutist, teacher, repairwomen, and community band founder.  Jenn, who was encouraged to participate with music from the excitement of her father during her public-school years and beyond, has become a strong advocate for community music.

From becoming a student who ate lunch all the time in the band room, involved in many music activities in high school, and became the drum major, Jenn has had a passion to be connected to music.  Jenn shared experiences, such as the leadership seminar she took during her time as a drum major, that changed her outlook in life and with helping others.  Even though Jenn did stop playing flute after college for about 7 years, the itch to perform in a band led her to join a few local ensembles and even to create a community band.  Jenn organized a community band through a recreation program within the local town.
