The ATLANTA NEW HORIZONS BAND, founded in April 1999, provides opportunities for adults to play music again after they had been active in school programs and then inactive for a long period. Music playing may also have been interrupted due to professional or other life circumstances. 
  
ANHB wants to invite these folks to renew their interest and passion. Now may be the time of life when you have the chance to devote it to music. We perform at a variety of venues such as churches, retirement homes, festivals and more.  We are welcoming players for all sections with the ability to read music.

The rehearsal location is Redwood Church at St. John (formerly known as ST. John UMC), 
550 Mt. Paran Road, Atlanta, GA 30327. S
