Music playing may also have been interrupted due to professional or other life circumstances. ANHB wants to invite these folks to renew their interest and passion. Now may be the time of life when you have the chance to devote it to music. We perform at a variety of venues such as churches, retirement homes, festivals etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Composed in 1924, John Philip Sousa&amp;rsquo;s Black Horse Troop March is a vibrant tribute to the U.S. Army’s 3rd Cavalry Regiment, known as the &amp;ldquo;Black Horse Troop.&amp;rdquo; Written for their annual dinner, this march captures Sousa’s signature flair with bold brass, lively rhythms, and a spirited melody. Its galloping tempo evokes the energy of cavalry on the move, making it a favorite among bands and audiences. Check out a performance to feel the patriotic pulse of this American classic!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
